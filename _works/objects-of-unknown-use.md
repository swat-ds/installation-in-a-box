Description: |-
  Objects of Unknown Use is a book that reflects upon two very different systems of belief, aliens and death. Inspired by the simultaneous reading of three texts; a UFO encounter blog, a catalog of The Egyptian Museum of Antiquities, and R.O. Faulkner's translation of The Egyptian Book of the Dead, the book weaves together the narrative voices of future and past, life and afterlife. These voices intertwine and become a science fiction poetic text, complemented by atmospheric imagery of skies, objects, and wings, a symbol of flight and the soul. <br/>
