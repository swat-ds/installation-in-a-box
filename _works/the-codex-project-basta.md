Description: |+
  This book is from the first iteration of The Codex Project, an annual curatorial project of open-ended artwork made within bound books over the course of a year, of which I am a founder and lead organizer. By its design, the project intrinsically suggests that the creator analyze themselves, and what quality subjectively means to them. In my interpretation, the self was symbolically represented by a face. The Codex pages are composed as a chronicle of imperfect copies of a single sculpted face, arranged and interpreted differently on each page, with the occasional addition of small drawings and embossed paper. I sculpted my self-portrait, which was molded and cast in apoxie before it could solidify. The casts, distorted, never matched the original sculpture ̶ which I thought of as the “idea” of the self. The subtly changing faces on each page are not only a representation of variances of one’s thoughts and consciousness through time, but more importantly, their process encourages acceptance of imperfection and change.Part of 2019’s The CODEX Project.<br/>
