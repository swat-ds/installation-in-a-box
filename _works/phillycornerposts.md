Description: "The once-ubiquitous posts of corner properties in Philadelphia are disappearing
  as buildings are torn down or remodeled. Keep an eye out and you will see them in
  neighborhoods settled in the mid-late 1800's. <br/>\nâ€”Jon Snyder<br/><br/>\n\nCreated
  for the 2019 RiTUAL exhibition of single-sheet artists' books organized by @heavy.bubble. "
