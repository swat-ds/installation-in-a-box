Description: "Part of 2019’s The CODEX Project. The Codex Project is an intensive
  project and exhibition of 19 artists, who are annually invited to create authentic,
  open-ended artwork individually within a bound book over the course of a year …
  The project is meant to encourage artists to question what drives and challenges
  them, inviting proactive change and potential in as many ways as possible. By showing
  the artists' books together in the same format, we hope to strengthen the idea that
  the pursuit of quality work is equal, and the differences between the pieces inside
  them shows how quality is self-defined.<br/> \n—The Codex Project"
