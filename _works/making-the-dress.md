Description: "For a variety of reasons, I was always fascinated with the world of
  sewing, an area for which I have no talent or patience. It is an industry that provided
  many women with a means to earn a wage. In the best circumstances, women would take
  in sewing as a home based business which allowed them to work and watch their children.
  In other instances, the work was done in factories that ran the gamut of well paid
  union jobs to sweatshops. Textiles were a large part of Philadelphia Industry and
  the founding of a college dedicated to the craft in the late 1800s is another indication
  of their importance in the Philadelphia community. So this book was made as an homage
  to all the women who were (and still are) skilled in this field.<br/> \nâ€”Diane Podolsky"
