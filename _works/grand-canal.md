Description: "Venice's Grand Canal is depicted in this tunnel book, highlighting the
  chaotic mix of local fauna, gondolas, traghettos and bridges vying for space on
  the waterway, with the ominous visage of a cruise ship lurking on the horizon. The
  cover panel is an eye shape that you look through into the Grand canal scene.<br/>
  \nâ€”Alice Austin"
