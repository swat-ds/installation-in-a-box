Description: |-
  Cycles is inspired by the song 'We Are Nowhere and it’s Now' by Bright Eyes. The lyrics deal with themes of mental illness, substance abuse, and existential dread. My personal work involves creating visuals that embody different experiences of mental illness. As mental illness is cyclical, the book is bound to stand as a concertina. The text used in Cycles derives from the lyrics but has been altered to support the personal nature of the book. Throughout the book, I use natural abstractions created through pulp painting and screen printing that portray the ebb and flow of life itself.  Being stuck in the moments in between. As the imagery continues, they become more illustrative as they are screen printed from hand drawn images.  Being a superstitious person by nature, I use imagery of luck and good fortune, such as, a rabbit’s foot designed after my cat’s lucky foot and a wish bone. As the imagery shifts throughout Cycles, the use of two colors, teal and magenta, creates a connection. The fact that this book stems from personal experiences, the use of the hand is very vital.<br/>
