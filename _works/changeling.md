Description: "This is a letterpress book and broadside combo, that revolves around
  the idea of the mythological creature known as the changeling, a creature that replaces
  children who were stolen away by supernatural creatures. From a modern understanding,
  it is thought that these creatures were an allegory for childhood developmental
  disorders, and the parallel between the language used then and used now is explored.<br/>
  \nâ€”Sara Moose-Torres"
