Description: |-
  Journal-painting project that explores a three-mile stretch of Philadelphia’s historic Schuylkill River, as it passes through Fairmount Park from East Falls to Fairmount Waterworks, beside the Philadelphia Museum of Art. <br/><br/>

  View of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Fairmount Water Works by the Fish Ladder on the western end of the dam.<br/><br/>

  LOOKING SOUTH FROM THREE ANGELS. A broad esplanade on the eastern bank was created when landfill replaced pestilential wetlands. A grove of cherry trees was created from a gift to the city by Japan, honoring the sesquicentennial of American independence. Rising behind the Connecting Railway Bridge is the distant form of the Comcast Technology Center.<br/>
