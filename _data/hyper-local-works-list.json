The Codex Project is an intensive project and exhibition of 19 artists, who are annually invited to create authentic, open-ended artwork individually within a bound book over the course of a year … The project is meant to encourage artists to question what drives and challenges them, inviting proactive change and potential in as many ways as possible. By showing the artists' books together in the same format, we hope to strengthen the idea that the pursuit of quality work is equal, and the differences between the pieces inside them shows how quality is self-defined.<br/> \n—The Codex Project",

My personal work involves creating visuals that embody different experiences of mental illness. As mental illness is cyclical, the book is bound to stand as a concertina. The text used in Cycles derives from the lyrics but has been altered to support the personal nature of the book. Throughout the book, I use natural abstractions created through pulp painting and screen printing that portray the ebb and flow of life itself.  Being stuck in the moments in between. As the imagery continues, they become more illustrative as they are screen printed from hand drawn images.  Being a superstitious person by nature, I use imagery of luck and good fortune, such as, a rabbit’s foot designed after my cat’s lucky foot and a wish bone. As the imagery shifts throughout Cycles, the use of two colors, teal and magenta, creates a connection. The fact that this book stems from personal experiences, the use of the hand is very vital.<br/>\n—Angelique Kopacz",

In the best circumstances, women would take in sewing as a home based business which allowed them to work and watch their children. In other instances, the work was done in factories that ran the gamut of well paid union jobs to sweatshops. Textiles were a large part of Philadelphia Industry and the founding of a college dedicated to the craft in the late 1800s is another indication of their importance in the Philadelphia community. So this book was made as an homage to all the women who were (and still are) skilled in this field.<br/> \n—Diane Podolsky",

By its design, the project intrinsically suggests that the creator analyze themselves, and what quality subjectively means to them. In my interpretation, the self was symbolically represented by a face. The Codex pages are composed as a chronicle of imperfect copies of a single sculpted face, arranged and interpreted differently on each page, with the occasional addition of small drawings and embossed paper. I sculpted my self-portrait, which was molded and cast in apoxie before it could solidify. The casts, distorted, never matched the original sculpture ̶ which I thought of as the “idea” of the self. The subtly changing faces on each page are not only a representation of variances of one’s thoughts and consciousness through time, but more importantly, their process encourages acceptance of imperfection and change.Part of 2019’s The CODEX Project.<br/>\n—Kaitlyn Basta\n\n",
